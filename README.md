# seagems

Casual game made with Phaser

## Description

This is a casual browser-based game about collecting jewells under the sea. It's made with JavaScript and Phaser CE.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- NodeJS
- Yarn
- Bower
- Express
- Phaser CE

### Installation

Go to project folder and install the server side dependencies:

```bash
cd project_folder
yarn install
```

Then install the client side dependencies:

```bash
yarn build
```

### How to run it

> Tip: works better in Firefox browser. There seems to be a bug in the Chrome-based browsers, preventing text from being displayed on the canvas.

Start the web server:

```bash
yarn start
```

By default the server listens on port 8080. But you can change this by using environment variables. For example:

```bash
export PORT=3000
```
